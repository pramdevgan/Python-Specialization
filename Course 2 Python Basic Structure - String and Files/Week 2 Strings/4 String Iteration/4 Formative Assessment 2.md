# **Formative Assessment 2**

## **String Iteration**
Select all of the variables do you need to declare to iterate over a string with a while loop. Hint, there is more than one correct answer.


- You do not need any additional variables when iterating over a string with a while loop
- ***A variable to represent the length of the string***
- ***A variable to represent the index***
- A variable to represent the datatype of the string variable

```
Using a while loop to iterate over a string requires a variable to represent the length of the string and another to represent the index.
