    "Use the variable x as you write this program. x will represent a positive integer. Write a program that determines if x is divisible by 5 and even. If yes, print _ is divisible by 5 and even, where the blank is the value of x. If no, print _ is not divisible by 5 or it is odd, where the blank is the value of x.\n",

    "Two things have to be true (divisible by 5 and even), so you need to use a compound conditional. Since both of these need to be true, use the **and** keyword to connect the boolean expressions. You will also need to print a message if the compound conditional is false, so use the **else** keyword. There are no more questions so do not use **elif**. Here is one possible solution:"
