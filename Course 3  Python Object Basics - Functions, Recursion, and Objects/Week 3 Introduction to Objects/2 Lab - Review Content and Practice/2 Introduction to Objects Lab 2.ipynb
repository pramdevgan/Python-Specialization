Third, run the `mainloop` for the window. Just like with Turtle graphics, the `import` statement should be at the very top of the program, and the `mainloop` should come at the very end. The rest of your program will go between these two lines of code."

    "* Justify - The `justify` option allows you to align text inside of a `Label`. The options are `\"left\"`, `\"right\"`, and `\"center\"`. An example of the `justify` option is: `justify=\"left\"`.\n",
    "* Background Color - Use the `bg` option to set the background color. Colors can be done with either CSS or hex colors. An example of the `bg` option is: `bg=\"blue\"`.\n",
    "* Text Color - Use the `fg` option (foreground) to set the color of the text. An example of the `fg` option is: `fg=\"red\"`.\n",
    "* Wrap Length - Widgets set their size based on its contents. While this can be helpful, this can also make getting the perfect layout difficult at times. The `wraplength` option tells `Tkinter` when to continue the text on the next line. This keeps the label widget from becoming too wide for your desired layout.\n",

Here is how to place the `my_label` widget in the top-left corner.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "my_label.grid(row=0, column=0)\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "Using an image in a label is also a two-step process. First create an image object for `Tkinter`, then attach the image to the label by replacing the `text` option with `image`. You still need to use `grid` to place the image in the window."
