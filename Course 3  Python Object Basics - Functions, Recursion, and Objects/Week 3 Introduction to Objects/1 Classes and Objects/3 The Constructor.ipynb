    "The constructor is a special method (more on methods in another lesson) for a class. Its job is to define all of attributes associated with the object. These attributes are called instance variables. In Python, the constructor is coded as `__init__`. The double underscores before and after `init` are required. The constructor also **must** have `self` as a parameter. Use the same syntax for the constructor as you would a function. Be sure to indent the constructor four spaces since it is a part of the class. Attributes will be referred to as `self.attribute_name`. Instantiating `helen` as an instance of the `Actor` class automatically calls the constructor.\n",
