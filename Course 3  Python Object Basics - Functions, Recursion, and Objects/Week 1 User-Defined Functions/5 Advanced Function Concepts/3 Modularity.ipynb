    "Another benefit to using functions in your programs is modularity. Modularity means dividing a program into separate and independent units. In a previous lesson, you used Pythonâ€™s turtle graphics to draw a house. Think about how you would write functions to draw the following image. The red dots represents the starting points for each of the shapes. Look for repeating patterns and think about how these patterns could be represented in a modular way.\n",

    "The image is composed of two shapes: a rectangle (a square is a rectangle with four sides of equal length) and a triangle. You also need the ability to reposition the turtle without drawing any lines on the screen. These are the three functions that will make up the drawing."
