    "## Lab 2 - Sorting the Movie Data\n",
    "\n",
    "You saw how to sort a list with the `sort` method. But sorting the movie data is a bit tricky because it is a list of lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "![List of Lists](https://apollo-media.codio.com/media/1/dfaa323da1831bb73552a2ea15989f5b-d0790862-c481-487f-af6b-017b60533da5.webp)\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the `sort` method on the outer list will arrange the movies in alphabetical order. We want the application to be able to sort the movie data in a variety of ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Sort Outer List](https://apollo-media.codio.com/media/1/2d07d953b11f740b25b214cbbadc8302-8cb4567d-5f4a-4ca8-8239-c6e85c75e7f7.webp)\n",
    "\n",
    "What if, for example, the user wants to sort the data by date of release? Using the sort method on each inner list rearranges the order of the movie info. That means the function you just wrote to print the movie info will not work as intended. There also exists a case in which the star rating will come before the date. A movie with a rating of `\"1 Star\"` will come after the release date if it is `\"2007\"`.\n",

    "![Sort Inner Lists](https://apollo-media.codio.com/media/1/1c5e844ffd794eb392b2f9a727b79a33-e97aab4c-7dbb-4508-850f-71472af22ced.webp)\n",
    "\n",
    "Thankfully Python has a way to sort `movie_data` by elements of the inner lists without messing up the output of the program. Import the `operator` module along with `csv`. Next, define the function `sort_movie_data` with the parameters `data` and `index`. Make the function body `pass`."

Sorting all of `movie_data` will take the headers from the CSV file and mix them up with the movies themselves. Instead create a list called `header` and set its value to `data[0]`. Then make another list called `sorted_movies` and set its value to `data[1:]`. The first row of `movie_data` (the column titles) is stored in `header`. And the rest of `movie_data` is stored in `sorted_movies`. Except the movie information has not yet been sorted. You are going to use the `sort` method on `sorted_movies`, but put the following code in between the parentheses `key=operator.itemgetter(index)`. Then return data. Finally, change the function call for `print_movie_data` to `print_movie_data(sort_movie_data(movie_data, 0))`."
