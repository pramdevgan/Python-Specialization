## Formative Assessment

Assume you want to write a recursive function that multiplies each element in a list by the number 5. What should the base case be?

- **When the length of the list is 1**
- When the length of the list is 0
- When the list is equal to 1
- When the list is equal to 0

The program should keep recursing until the **length** of the list is 1. A length of 1 means there is only one element left in the list. There is no reason to keep calling the function when once the list is empty.
