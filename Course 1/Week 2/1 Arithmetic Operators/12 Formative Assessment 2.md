# **Formative Assessment 2**

### *Python Operators*
Which operation should be performed first in the following expression?
```
7 / 2 + (5 % 2 * 5) ** 2 - 3
```

- 5 % 2 * 5
- 7 / 2
- 5 % 2  **Correct Answer**
- 5 ** 2

```
Using PEMDAS, the first operation to be performed is the parentheses. However, there are two operations inside the parentheses. Since modulo and multiplication fall into the same category of PEMDAS, these operations are done left to right. So 5 % 2 is performed first.
