## **Formative Assessment 1**

**If Statement**
What does an if statement not do?

- Evaluates a boolean expression.
- Evaluates code when the boolean expression is false.
- Allows your program to make decisions about what to do.
- Determines if something is True or False.


        An if statement does not do anything if the boolean expression is false. It only tests to see if a condition is true. A false expression skips the indented code.
