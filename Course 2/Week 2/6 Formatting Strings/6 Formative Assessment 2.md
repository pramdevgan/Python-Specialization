## String Interpolation

Which of the following are recommended ways you should perform string interpolation in  **Python 3** ?  **Hint** , there is more than one correct answer.

- **Using `+` or commas**
- Using `%`
- **Using the `format` method**
- **Using f-strings**

You should not be using the `%` operator for string interpolation. Python has adopted other ways to integrate variables in a string.
