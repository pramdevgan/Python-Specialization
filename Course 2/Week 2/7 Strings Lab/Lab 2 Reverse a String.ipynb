    "Since the string needs to be reversed, our loop should start at the end of the string and work its way to the first character. So the for loop used in Lab 1 will not work. We are going to use a while loop. To do this, we need a variable that represents the index. Normally, the index starts at zero, but this loop will go backwards through the string. The starting index needs to be the last character in the string. The `length` method returns the length of a string. However, the length of a string is always one greater than the last index (because indexes start counting at zero). So the starting index should be the length of the string minus one.\n",
