# **Formative Assessment 1**

## **String Methods**
Look at the before and after code samples below:

**Before:** the brown dog jumps over the lazy fox <br>
**After:** THE BROWN CAT JUMPS OVER THE LAZY FOX <br>
What two string methods would you use to change the text?

- Swap and upper
- ***Replace and upper***
- Replace and capitalize
- Exchange and title

You would use the `replace` method to change `dog` to `cat`, and the `upper` method to make all of the characters uppercase. There is not a string method named `replace`, `swap`, or `exchange`. The `capitalize` method only makes the first letter of the string upper case. The `title` method makes the first character of each word uppercase.
