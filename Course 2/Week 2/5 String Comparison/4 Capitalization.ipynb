    "To humans, the words “dog” and “Dog” are the same. Python, however, is case sensitive. That means a difference in capitalization implies two different words. When dealing with user input, the rules of capitalization are often not followed. The input command instructs Python to pause the program until the user has typed something and pressed `Return`. **Important**, Python treats all user input as a string. If you want a number, use typecasting to convert it to the proper data type.\n",
