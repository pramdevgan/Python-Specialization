# File Iteration - While Loop

---

## Readline vs. Readlines

The `readlines` method reads all of the lines at once and returns them in a list. There is another method called `readline`. The `readline` method returns only one line from the text file. Python automatically keeps track of which lines have been read, and which have not.

## What happens if you:

* Change `readline()` to `readlines()`?
* Change the code to look like this:

```python
with open("student_folder/text/read_practice.txt", "r") as read_file:
    print(read_file.readline(), end="")
    print(read_file.readline(), end="")
```


## While Loop

While loops can also iterate over a text file. Remember, while loops require a stop condition to keep it from becoming an infinite loop. Each text file ends with an empty string (`""`). That is how Python knows it has reached the end of a file. So a while loop should each line of the text file until it reaches the empty string. Because of this, iterating over a text with a while loop will use `readline` instead of `readlines`. It is important to read the first line of the text file **before** starting the while loop. And, read the next line of the text file **inside** the while loop as well.

## What happens if you:

* Chage the first `line = read_file.readline()` to `readlines()`?
* Remove the first `line = read_file.readline()`?
* Put back the first `line = read_file.readline()` and remove the second one?
