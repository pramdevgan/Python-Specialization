    "This unit is all about working with files on a computer. The first step is to open the desired file. That means navigating the file system to find the file in question. The open command requires the location (path) of the file and the filename. The file is called `practice1.txt`. It is located in the `text` folder, which is inside the folder called `student_folder`. **So the path to the file is `student_folder/text/practice1.txt`.**\n",
