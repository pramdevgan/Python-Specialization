    "The lab will cover how to encrypt the contents of a file with a Caesar cipher. This cipher will work with any characters that are letters (uppercase and lowercase), the digits 0 to 9, and the symbols space, exclamation, question mark, and the period. Other symbols will not be encrypted. The Caesar cipher requires a key to work as well. The key is any number from 0 to 25.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Caesar cipher works by having a list of all of the symbols that can be encrypted. Take the letter you want to encrypt and find its place in the list. Add the value of the key to the position to get the encrypted letter. If the new position is greater than the end of the list, keep counting from the beginning of the list. The example below assumes a key of 13, and shows that a `\"K\"` becomes `\"X\"` with the Caesar cipher.\n",
