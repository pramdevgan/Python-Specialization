### ***Formative Assessment 1***

**Which Operator?**
Which operator will tell if a list contains a certain value?


-  The `len` function
-  The concatenation (`+`) operator
-  The slice (`:`) operator
- <font color = green> The `in` operator </font>


To see if a value is an element of a list, use the `in` operator.
The `len` function tells you the length of a list. The concatenation operator appends one list to another. Finally, the slice operator returns a subset of a list.
