A miscellaneous color would any color that is not in the `warm`, `cool`, or `neutral` lists. Instead, iterate over the `colors` list and see if each element is in the `warm`, `cool`, or `neutral` lists. If an element is not in those three lists, then it is a miscellaneous color."

No type casting is necessary. Both options do the same things."
